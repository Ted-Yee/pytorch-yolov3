# Introduction

This directory contains PyTorch YOLOv3 software.



# Requirements

Python 3.7 or later with the following `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt` packages:

- `numpy`
- `torch >= 1.1.0`
- `opencv-python`
- `tqdm`

# Training

**Start Training:** `python3 train.py` to begin training after downloading COCO data with `data/get_coco_dataset.sh`. Each epoch trains on 117,263 images from the train and validate COCO sets, and tests on 5000 images from the COCO validate set.

**Resume Training:** `python3 train.py --resume` to resume training from `weights/last.pt`.
